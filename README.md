# Effect of calibration data subsetting on Boolean model calibration and drug synergy predictions

This repository includes scripts and files used in my master's project. The aim of the project was to investigate the effect of calibration data subsetting on Boolean model calibration and synergy predictions, using the DrugLogics pipeline. The main hypothesis was that including the target state for a set of driver nodes would be sufficient to obtain a calibrated model with a stable state reflecting a complete target state, as the stable state of a Boolean model is determined by the state of a driver set.
